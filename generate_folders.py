Welcome to my journey through the 45 Days of DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Challenge! This repository is my personal tracker where I document my progress as I tackle a variety of DSA problems over the next 45 days. Join me as I enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Introduction

This challenge is all about consistent practice and learning. Each day, I will solve different problems, write up my solutions, and share my notes. The aim is to build a solid foundation in DSA through daily commitment and continuous improvement.

## Daily Progress

'''

# Add links to each day's README.md
for day in range(1, 46):
    main_readme_content += f'- [Day {day}](Day_{day:02}/README.md) '

main_readme_content += '''

## Folder Structure

Each day has its own folder, which contains the following files:

- `README.md` - A summary of the problems solved on that day.
- `solutions/` - A directory containing the solutions to the problems.
- `notes.md` - Any notes or observations made while solving the problems.
